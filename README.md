The Steven Universe Gem Collector Game

Click any of the character gems to add a hidden number to your UserScore, then try to reach the ComputerScore without going over! Wins and losses are tracked to the side, and every new game a new ComputerScore is set.

This game was challenging and fun to create! The random number generators were easy to code, but the reset function was difficult to activate. Styling this page was engaging, as my kids love the show Steven Universe. There were some challenges in the layout with getting the gem button margins equal, and the game score divs were not properly aligned with the rest of the cells.

Overall a lot of fun!
